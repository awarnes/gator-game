# Project GatorGame
Name TBD

Here's the start of the gator game. Mostly there's just some basic placeholders for screens, and moving around.

TipTap Studio's second production, GatorGame is a tycoon style game set on an alligator farm in the remote country side of New Mexico. Based on an untrue story, you'll play as Billy or Linny, the children of the original owners. You've got only so long to make this the best Gator Farm in New Mexico. Do you have what it takes? :P

## Next Steps:
- In the future, I would like to work towards the ECS system.
- Next, implement gator farm scene with feeding, care, and harvest of gators.
- Actual implementation of gator dynamics.

## To Build:
1. Currently, using Unity 2018.3.2f1
2. Open project
3. Go to File > Build Settings... and select `Build and Run`.
4. Select the system you want to build for.
  - Make sure to select `Development Build` at this point.
5. And away you go! :fingers-crossed:

## Appreciation:
Thank you to [Kenney Assets](https://www.kenney.nl/assets) for the environment assets, and [Brik](https://www.brik.co/blogs/posters/tagged/alligator) for inspiration on the initial gator sprite model.
